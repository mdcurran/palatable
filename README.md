## Motivation

I really want some simple method of recording what things I've tried at bars or
restaurants or events. In future I can look back at what's been recorded and
help me make recommendations to friends, ensure I don't go somewhere I didn't
like twice, and so on.

Most apps are too large in scope (Foursquare), or aren't suitable. Untapped is
great just for beer, but I want something more general, without all the
invasive social media and advertising noise.
